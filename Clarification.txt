1. For all the questions, 
(A) The task set consists of only periodic tasks. 
(B) Number of tasks in the task set is also an input in input file.
(C) You need to calculate all the parameters similar to Assignment 2. 
(D) For all the tasks assume deadline is same as period [but maintain 2 separate member variables for period and deadline].
(E) You need to find actual execution time as 50% to 100% of WCET.
(F) Tasks can be out of phase. You should schedule the task set from 0 to min of (3*hyper-period, first in-phase time + hyper period)

2. Add pre-emption overhead as 0.2 units and decision making overhead as 0.1 units.

3. For ccEDF and ccRM, the frequency/voltage level calculation overhead is 0.05 units.

4. ccEDF and ccRM should take an input file specifying the frequencies and voltages the processor is supporting [different processors will have different voltage and frequency support] [say 40% of Max to MAX]. Assuming the IDLE period is executed with MIN frequency, in addition to other parameters you need to calculate dynamic energy consumption of your schedule as well.

5. EDF and RM with Non-preemptive jobs and self suspension should display the offline phase to guarantee the schedulability. There should be a file which specifies what all [start time and end time] are the non-preemptive portions of each job [only the jobs with non-preemptive portions will have entry in this file]. There should be a file spefifying self suspension time [after how much of execution - how long] of each job [only the jobs with self suspension will have entry in this file]. There can be multiple entries in corresponding files if there are multiple non-preemptive portion / self-suspension.
   
6. For EDFRCS, extension time calculation overhead is 0.05 units

7. For all algorithms you are allowed to call the scheduler only at decision points [arrival/departure/slack change ....]. [You are not allowed to call the scheduler at each time unit.
